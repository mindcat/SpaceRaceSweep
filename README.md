## Inspiration
[Ben Vallack]() made a number of incredible videos on the ferris sweep (and it was his earlier videos reviewing the [gergoplex]() and [moonlander]() keyboards that led me to being interested in split keyboards and owning a moonlander myself, respectively). This linked one was vital to my problem solving and process, but I recommend checking out his other videos.
